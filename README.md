# ShardKeeper-WotLK

A simple World of Warcraft 3.3.5 (Wrath of the Lich King) addon for Warlocks.  
It helps you manage your **Soul Shards** automatically.

## What it does
- Lets you set a **cap** for how many Soul Shards you want to keep.  
- When you loot a new shard and you’re above the cap, the addon will delete the extra one.  
- Provides a small GUI accessible from a **minimap button** where you can:
  - Set your shard cap
  - See your current shard count
- Includes a quick toggle via **right-click on the minimap icon** to switch between cap = 0 and your default.

## Why use it?
- Keeps your bags clean from shard clutter.  
- Very lightweight and simple to use.  
- Perfect for Warlocks who don’t want to micromanage shards manually.
